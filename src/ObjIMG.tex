\paragraph{Objectives of the IMG subproject:}

The subproject IMG is in charge of the definition of clinical requirements for P10, and coordinates the operation of P10 as pre-clinical device in a clinical environment. It is also in charge of the animal farm and the manipulation of the radioisotope drugs. 
%The set of objectives related with this activities are grouped as IMG-VAL.

In addition, the IMG subproject will develop the software for PET imaging, as well as for the combination of PET and NMR data and PET-TOF.  
%The set of objectives related with this activities are grouped as IMG-NMR.

%\paragraph{IMG-VAL}
%
%\begin{enumerate}
%\item {\bf Characterisation and study of performance of P10  in a clinical environment}. 
%\begin{itemize}
%\item Definition of clinical requirements. Since P10 will be a medical device working with small animals, it will need to pass several quality and safety requirements to be used in a clinical environment. This will be done in parallel with the commissioning of P10 at IFIC (Q1/Q2-2018).
%\item Operation of P10 in a clinical environment with small animals. Access to the animal farm, definition of radioisotope drugs, operation protocols (Q3/Q4-18).
%\end{itemize}
%\end{enumerate}
%
%\paragraph{IMG-NMR}
%\begin{enumerate}
%\item {\bf Image processing and reconstruction}. 
%\begin{itemize}
%\item Development of the software for PET imaging (filtered back projection and interactive techniques, display of acquired images) using Monte Carlo Data for P2 and P10 (Q2-16/Q4-17).
%\item Testing of imaging software with P2 data (Q1/Q2-17).
%\item Development of the software for registration and fusion of the NMR and PET using different techniques (segmentation, atlas-based) for the generation of attenuation maps in the PET images correction (starts Q3-17 using P2 data).  
%\end{itemize} 
%\item {\bf Operation and optimisation of  P2 in a NMR environment.}
%\begin{itemize}
%\item Installation of P2 in the NMR experimental apparatus at La Fe. Acquisition of data. Validation of operation in magnetic field (Q3/Q4-17). 
%\end{itemize} 
%\item {\bf Operation and optimisation of  P10 in a NMR environment.}. 
%\begin{itemize}
%\item Installation of P2 in the NMR experimental apparatus at La Fe. Acquisition of data. Validation of operation in magnetic field  (Q1-19).   
%\item NMR images acquisition, development of protocols for the acquisition of images with combined NMR and PET data, full demonstration of system (Q2/Q4-2019).
%\end{itemize} 
%\end{enumerate}
